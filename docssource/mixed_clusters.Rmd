`r keywords("power analysis, mixed models, multiple clusters, participant by stimuli")`

`r version("0.8.2")`

Here we discuss some rules for handling clustering variables (grouping variables) in different designs.

# One clustering variable

Simple designs with one clustering variable are defined by specifying in `r opt("Model Syntax")` the “bars” component of the formula, such as:

```
y~1*1+1*x+(1*1|cluster)
```

:::{ .adm .adm-note}
Note

Hereinafter the coefficients are immaterial for our discussion, so we always set them to 1 and assume random intercepts only. The sample structure is not altered by the coefficient values or the definition of fixed and random effects. We also fill in all the cluster size fields: `# Cluster Levels` and `N per cluster`. It is clear that, depending on the aim of the analysis, one of these parameters will be determined by the algorithm.

:::

`r modulename()` reads `cluster` as the name of the clustering variable and displays the fields to be filled in to generate the correct sample based on the cluster variable definition.

`r pic("examples/mixed/example1/e1.input.1.png")`

Now, depending on the aim of the analysis, one needs to fill one of the fields (`# Cluster Levels` or `N per cluster`). Here we discuss the meaning of these fields, knowing that depending on the goal of the analysis, one of them will be the target of the power function.

With one clustering variable, `# Cluster levels` is the number of groups clustering the observations. In a multilevel design, say with pupils clustered within classes, `# Cluster levels` is the number of classes in the sample (or the number to be established by the power analysis). In a repeated-measures design with conditions repeated within participants, `# Cluster levels` is the number of participants.

`N per cluster` is the number of observations within each cluster level (group). In a multilevel design with pupils clustered within classes, `N per cluster` is the (average) number of pupils in the sample (or the number to be established by the power analysis). In a repeated-measures design with a condition repeated within participants, `N per cluster` is the number of measurements taken for each participant.

With one clustering variable, `N per cluster` should be at least 2, because without at least two measurements per cluster, not even a random intercept can be estimated. To estimate random slopes, `N per cluster` must be larger than 2; otherwise the model will not have sufficient degrees of freedom to estimate the variance of the coefficients.

### One-way repeated-measures ANOVA design

Assume we have a repeated-measures design with four time points (see an example in `r link_pages(nickname="ros_mixed_rm")`), and one measurement per participant (identified by the variable _ID_) at each time point. To define this design, we would input:

```
y~1*1+[1,1,1]*time+(1*1|ID)
```

Then we specify that `time` is a categorical variable with 4 levels.

`r pic("examples/mixed/example1/e1.input.2.png")`

and we set the cluster `N per cluster` to 4, indicating that one participant (the cluster unit) has 4 observations.

`r pic("examples/mixed/example1/e1.input.3.png")`

The resulting data look like this:

```
             y time      ID
1   0.64342217    1       1
2   0.15874249    2       1
3  -0.70961322    3       1
4  -1.46269242    4       1
5  -0.80773575    1       2
6   0.38518147    2       2
7  -1.95162686    3       2
8   2.98249154    4       2
9  -0.04821753    1       3
10 -1.61386528    2       3
11 -0.68877198    3       3
12  1.33885528    4       3
```

We can see that time is repeated within ID, with one measurement for each level of time. Table `Variable parameters (one sample)` also shows that we are simulating the correct design.

`r pic("examples/mixed/example1/e1.output.1.png")`

At the bottom is clearly stated that `PID` clusters have 4 observations each.

Note

To see an example of the data generated by your model in `r modulename()`, simply select the option `r opt("Data structure")` in `r opt_panel("Options")`. `r opt("Variables structure")` produces a table with information about the variables and their levels.

:::

Assume now we have a similar design, but within each time condition the participant is measured 5 times (5 trials). We still have the same model:

```
y~1*1+1*time+(1*1|ID)
```

and the same variable definition (time with 4 levels), but now `N per cluster` is 20, which is 4 levels of time × 5 trials.

`r pic("examples/mixed/example1/e1.input.4.png")`

The resulting data look like this (first participant):

```
              y time      ID
1    0.38563267    1       1
2    1.24833377    1       1

15   0.31462810    3       1
16   0.27796168    4       1
17   0.32836307    4       1
18  -0.34867872    4       1
19  -0.20470434    4       1
20  -0.71480958    4       1
```

:::{ .adm .adm-note}
Note

Notice that categorical variables are built to vary within clusters by default. This behavior is chosen because in power analysis for mixed model within-cluster variables are more common. However, `r modulename()` allows to specify between-clusters  categorical variables (and also continuous variables). Please read `r link_pages(nickname="mixed_designs")` for help on that.

# Multi-cluster designs

Here we discuss cases with more than one clustering variable. When more than one cluster variable is involved, things gets a bit complex (a dare I say ugly), but still those designs are doable in `r modulename()`. One needs a bit more patience.

Two cases are most relevant for researchers: __cross-classified__ clustering and __nested clustering__.

### Cross-classified clusters

A typical example of cross-classified clustering is an experimental design in which $P$ participants (identified by the variable _PID_) are tested with $S$ stimuli (variable _SID_). Every participant is exposed to each stimulus, and each stimulus is seen by all participants. We start with the simpler example in which there is only one measurement for each combination of participant and stimulus (a participant sees a stimulus only once).

The mixed model is:

```
y~1*1+1*x+(1*1|PID)+(1*1|SID)
```

Let’s say we want a sample of 10 participants and 5 stimuli. In total we have 50 observations, in which each participant has `N per cluster` equal to 1, and each stimulus has `N per cluster` equal to 1 as well. It may seem counterintuitive, but the participant is actually repeated only once, but their measurement is spread across 5 stimuli. Thus, we need to set:

`r pic("examples/mixed/example1/e2.input.1.png")`

The resulting data (first participant) will look like this:

```
        y       PID SID
1   0.741008569   1   1
2  -1.001295926   1   2
3   0.728456584   1   3
4   0.649785351   1   4
5  -1.373459856   1   5
6  -2.073459856   1   6
```

Now, what about a categorical variable (i.e., an experimental factor named _cond_)? If the variable is _between-subjects_, we simply declare it with the syntax keyword `bet: cond|PID` (see `r link_pages(nickname="mixed_syntax")`). For a 4-level _cond_, we have (first two participants):

```
  Row  x  PID  SID 
 1.00  b    1    1 
 2.00  b    1    2 
 3.00  b    1    3 
 4.00  b    1    4 
 5.00  b    1    5 
 6.00  b    1    6 
 7.00  b    2    1 
 8.00  b    2    2 
 9.00  b    2    3 
10.00  b    2    4 
11.00  b    2    5 
12.00  b    2    6 
13.00  b    3    1 
14.00  b    3    2 
15.00  b    3    3 
16.00  b    3    4 
17.00  b    3    5 
18.00  b    3    6 
19.00  a    4    1 
20.00  a    4    2 
21.00  a    4    3 
22.00  a    4    4 
23.00  a    4    5 
24.00  a    4    6 
25.00  a    5    1 
26.00  a    5    2 
27.00  a    5    3 
28.00  a    5    4 
29.00  a    5    5 
30.00  a    5    6 

```

The data structure can be seen also in `Variables parameters table` showing that each `PID` cluster (participant) has 6 observations and each stimulus (`SID`) is seen 10 times, once per participant.

`r pic("examples/mixed/example1/e2.output.2.png")`



If the variable is _within-subjects_, we must ensure that the number of observations per participant (here 6) is a multiple of its levels. With 6 observations, _cond_ can have 2 levels, 3 levels, or 6 levels; otherwise it cannot be repeated within participant. A 2-level factor would look like this:

```
             y cond PID SID
1   0.49915152    1   1   1
2   0.74412274    2   1   2
3  -1.13346819    1   1   3
4   0.86378973    2   1   4
5  -0.13518382    1   1   5
6   1.16554628    2   1   6
```

A more complex design arises when the repeated-measures factor _cond_ is repeated both within participants and within stimuli. Suppose each participant sees each stimulus in both conditions of factor _cond_. This implies that each stimulus has two observations, so we change its `N per cluster`:

`r pic("examples/mixed/example1/e2.input.2.png")`

and we obtain the desired design:

```
              y cond PID SID
1    1.61187894    1   1   1
2    0.41588941    2   1   1
3   -0.88306925    1   1   2
4   -0.42600560    2   1   2
5   -0.71458546    1   1   3
6   -1.00448085    2   1   3
7   -0.98879046    1   1   4
8    0.91321802    2   1   4
9    0.81331414    1   1   5
10   0.54411584    2   1   5
11  -0.15936292    1   1   6
12  -1.03945842    2   1   6
```

This means that each stimulus has $20$ observation (2 for each of the 10 participants), and each participants has $12$ observations, 2 per stimulus times 6 stimuli. Indeed, the data are generated accordinglu.

`r pic("examples/mixed/example1/e2.output.1.png")`


With the same logic, we can simulate designs with several trials within each combination of participant and stimulus. For instance, with the following setup:

`r pic("examples/mixed/example1/e2.input.3.png")`

each participant sees all stimuli 9 times. Accordingly, each participants has 54 observations (9 trials X 6 stimuli), and each stimulus features 90 observations (9 trials X 10 participants). Indeed:

`r pic("examples/mixed/example1/e2.output.3.png")`



### Nested cluster classification

Let us consider one of the classic multilevel design: pupils within classes within schools. In this design we have two clustering variables: _class_ and _school_. In multilevel terminology, pupils are level 0, classes are level 1 with pupils nested within classes, and schools are level 2 with classes nested within schools. To be practical, let us assume we want a sample with 10 schools, each with 6 classes, and each class (on average) with 12 pupils.

First, we set the model:

```
y~1*1+1*x+(1*1|school/class)
```

Then we specify that we have 10 schools, each with 6 classes, and each class has 12 observations (pupils).

`r pic("examples/mixed/example1/e3.input.1.png")`

The generated data look similar to the cross-classified data:

```
row   y             x           school  class
1    0.456717064 -1.017673137      1     1
2   -1.495551991  0.694440645      1     1
3   -0.480543438  0.194002872      1     1
4    0.293003240 -0.116523555      1     1
5   -1.702547420 -1.203825265      1     1
6    1.014035495  0.461345298      1     1
7   -0.415440850 -0.585482460      1     1
8   -1.524924282  0.544323536      1     1
9   -0.106578314 -0.196693360      1     1
10  -0.035543818 -2.741920747      1     1
11   0.229491601  0.170131727      1     1
12  -1.909614050 -1.159812029      1     1
13   1.190966855 -0.356247480      1     2
14  -2.028748115  0.489991721      1     2
15  -1.079830560  1.315918615      1     2
16   0.099924682 -0.330729467      1     2
17  -0.075449795 -2.424778270      1     2
....
```

However, the estimated model is different. If one looks at the `Effect size indices` table, one finds that the clusters are now `school` and `school:class`, which is exactly how the model specification expands.

`r pic("examples/mixed/example1/e3.output.1.png")`

In terms of cluster size, we obtain the resultas we intended

`r pic("examples/mixed/example1/e3.output.2.png")`

Let's check if the setup is correct:  each school has 6 classes with 12 pupils, so within each school there are 72 observations. Within each class nested in school there are 12 pupils. The data are ok.

:::{ .adm .adm-note}
Note

In mixed models estimated following the R package **lme4** syntax, the expression `(1 | school/class)` is just a shorthand for specifying nested random effects. The operator `school/class` expands internally into two terms: one random intercept for the grouping factor `school`, and one random intercept for the interaction (i.e., nesting) `school:class`. Formally, the random structure is:

```
(1 | school) + (1 | school:class)
```

Accordingly, the `Effect size indices` table indicates that the cluster variables are `school` and `school:class`.

The __general rule__ is that, in mixed models, “nesting” is not a separate statistical concept—it is only a syntactic shortcut. What matters is the definition of the grouping factors, which in this example are `school` and `school:class`. Random coefficients (whatever they are) are computed across the groups defined by these two variables.
