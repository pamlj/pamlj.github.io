`Mediation power analysis` allows for computing power parameters for testing indirect (mediated) effects in several mediational models. It can be used to estimate power parameters based on the `Sobel test`, `joint significance` or `Monte Carlo` method.

The initial step is to determine the objective of the analysis ( _aim_ ). Further details regarding different objectives can be found in the `Info` results field.

The second step is to decide what type of model we are dealing with. 

# Models

* __Simple mediation (three variables)__ : This is the classical simple mediation, with one independent variable, one mediator. The model looks like this

* __Complex mediation models__ : Allows computation of power parameters for more complex models: two parallel mediator, three paralell mediator and serial mediation with two mediators. They are, respectively:
