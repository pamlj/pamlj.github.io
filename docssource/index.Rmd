# Install in jamovi

Please install [jamovi](https://www.jamovi.org/download.html) and run it. Select the jamovi modules library and install PAMLj from there


## From GitHub

In your R script (or Rstudio) simply issue 

```
library(jmvtools)
devtools::install_github("pamlj/pamlj")

```

## From source


You will first need to download [jamovi](https://www.jamovi.org/download.html). 

You can clone this repository and compile the module within R with 

```
library(jmvtools)

jmvtools::install()

```


# Programmatic name

```
