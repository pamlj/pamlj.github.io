**Correlation** Power Analysis

`r version("0.1.0")`

# Correlation

`Correlation` allows computing power parameters for testing the Pearson or Spearman correltion coefficient. The first thing to to is to decide the aim of the analysis. Some text in `Info` results field explains the different aims. 

`r pic("commons/pics/aims.1.png")`

For correlation analysis, it also suggests the following:

`r pic("pics/correlation/aims.2.png")`

We start with the first aim,

## N: Required sample size

When we want to compute the required sample size for a planned research, we need to anticipate, from pilots, meta-analysis, etc., but see [@albers2017biased], an effect size. In case of correlation, not surprising, the effect size is the Pearson correlation.

Let assume we want to estimate the __required sample size (N)__ for a planned research for which we expect the correlation between our target variables to be .20, and we want to achieve a power of .90 with a two-tailed test, evaluated at $\alpha=.05$. In `r modulename()` we simply plug in these parameters.

`r pic("pics/correlation/r.1.png")`

From the result table we can see that the required N is 258, so we need 258 case to achieve a power of .90 given an expected correlation of .2. 

The second table we get is the `Power by Effect" table, which inform us on the different power levels associated with different possible effect sizes. 

`r pic("pics/correlation/r.2.png")`

Based on the estimate $N=258$, we should expected a very low power ($1-\beta<.5$) were the actual population effect size less then .122. A power of $1-\beta<$ between .5 and .80 should be expected were our effect size be between .122 and .173. A power between .80 and .95 is to be expected if our population effect size is between .173 and .222, whereas a power greater than .95 can be expected is the population correlation is larger than .222.

## Sensitivity analysis

Sensitivity analysis means exploring different scenarios. `r opt("Power contour plot")` visualize the power from green (low) to yellow (high) as a function of possible sample size (x-axis) and effect (correlation) size. 

`r pic("pics/correlation/r.3.png")`

In the power contour plot, we see the solid line representing the combinations of Sample Size (N) and effect size that will yield the required power (in the example .90). So we know how the power will change had we underestimated the effect size (go down in y-axis) or underestimated the sample size (go left on the x-axis).

The second plot we can ask is the `r opt("Power curve by N")`. It portraints how the power (y-axis) chances as one increases the sample size (x-axis).

`r pic("pics/correlation/r.4.png")`

In this example we can see that if we were not able to collect more than 150 case, our expected power will not be more than .70 (to be optimistic).
