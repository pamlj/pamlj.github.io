`GLM power analysis` allows for computing power parameters for testing a wide range of effect across several different designs. It can be used to estimate power parameters for regression, ANOVA, ANCOVA models, for different types of effects (main effects, interactions, etc.).

The initial step is to determine the objective of the analysis ( _aim_ ). Further details regarding different objectives can be found in the `Info` results field.

The second step is to decide what type of effect size we want to employ. 

# Effect size indexes

* __Partial Eta-Squared__ : valuable for any application of the GLM, such as ANOVA, ANCOVA, regression, for individual effects and overall test ($R^2$).

* __Eta-Squared__ : valuable for any application of the GLM, such as ANOVA, ANCOVA, regression, for individual effects and blocks of effects ($\Delta R^2$).

* __Beta coefficients__ : valuable in particular for regression for individual effects.

Please select the effect size index to go to its dedicated page.
